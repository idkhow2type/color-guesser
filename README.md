# Project Title

This is a simple JavaScript game where the player guesses RGB color values. The game generates a random RGB color and the player has to guess the values. The score is calculated based on how close the player's guess is to the actual values.

## Getting Started

Go to this [website](https://idkhow2type.github.io/color-guesser/) to play the game.

## Usage

The game starts when the player makes their first guess. The number of guesses and the time are displayed on the screen. The game ends when the player guesses the correct RGB values. The player can reset the game at any point by clicking the reset button.
